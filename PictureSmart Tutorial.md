Using PictureSmart: A Guide for JAWS Users
# Introduction
PictureSmart is a powerful tool built into the JAWS screen reading program. It allows blind computer users to explore images, leveraging artificial intelligence to provide easily readable image descriptions. Because of its use of AI, it generates results within moments, allowing blind individuals to shop online, view family albums, or read charts and graphs independently. This tutorial will explain how to use PictureSmart effectively.
## **Important Notice**
This tutorial is intended to provide a basic overview of the PictureSmart feature. This documentation is not considered official training provided by Freedom Scientific, a Vispero brand. Further, this tutorial is not intended to replace or modify the official [documentation](https://www.freedomscientific.com/training) provided by Freedom Scientific.
# Foundations
This guide assumes that you are familiar with the JAWS screen reading program, including the JAWS key and basic keyboard commands. If you are not familiar with the JAWS software, you can [consult the Freedom Scientific website](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/) for more information, including a list of keyboard shortcuts, training materials, and system recommendations.
## Key Terms
Before using PictureSmart, it’s important to understand a few key definitions:
- The Layered Command – The layered command in JAWS is a keyboard shortcut (Insert+Space), which allows the user to enter various layers to access JAWS features. If you’re using JAWS in Laptop layout, you can press Caps Lock+Space instead. You will know that you have entered the layered command correctly if you hear a distinct popping sound.
- Layer – A layer in JAWS refers to an available feature that is activated by the layered command, such as the volume layer, PictureSmart layer, or the table layer.
- Results Viewer – The results viewer is a JAWS process that allows you to navigate through generated descriptions. This feature is most commonly used by PictureSmart and the OCR layer to view the text from scanned documents or images.
# What is PictureSmart?
PictureSmart is a feature integrated into JAWS that uses artificial intelligence to analyze images. After processing the image, it generates an accessible text description using two AI platforms (ChatGPT and Claude). You can copy and paste the generated descriptions into a text editor if desired.
## When to Use PictureSmart
There are many scenarios where you may want to use PictureSmart:
- Online Shopping – If you find yourself shopping online, such as on Amazon, products of all types are displayed using pictures. This helps shoppers decide if they want it with just a quick glance. Everything from clothes, home decor, tools, and cookware all come in different colors, designs, and may match with certain styles over others. Thus, having as much information on a product is crucial, and web designers may not place this key info into alt text. PictureSmart will assist you, as it provides thorough descriptions of items, including color and shape.
- Viewing Screenshots – Whether you are at work, school, helping a friend, or conducting research, screenshots often are used to help users get an idea of what they may be looking at. Support representatives, for example, may view screenshots of a user’s computer screen to better diagnose an issue. Students may view screenshots built into presentations that show equations, and online tutorials and step-by-step guides make frequent use of screenshots to aid the user, so they know what they need to look for.
Overall, images are unavoidable. Charts, graphs, scanned files, family albums, and PowerPoint slides are all examples of items that JAWS users have often been unable to read. With features such as PictureSmart, these often essential elements of daily life are now more accessible than ever.
# Using PictureSmart
To use this feature, access the layered command and then enter the PictureSmart layer:
1. Activate the layered command as described above (press Insert+Space, or Caps Lock+Space on a laptop) and then listen for the popping sound. Press the letter P to enter the PictureSmart layer, which will be announced by JAWS.
2. Use a keyboard command. Once inside the PictureSmart layer, you can choose from several keyboard commands, depending on your needs. Some of the most common commands are pressing Enter, the letter F, or the letter C.
3. Wait for the result. Once you have activated the command, you will hear JAWS make clicking noises, indicating that it is analyzing the image and generating a description. Once this process is complete, you will enter the results viewer automatically. Read your description, then press Escape when you’re done.
## Common Keyboard Commands
This guide will not cover all of the keyboard commands or their uses for PictureSmart. For more information or a full description, it is recommended that you check the [official documentation](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/) provided by Freedom Scientific. Below are some of the more common commands and their uses:
- Enter – Pressing the enter key lets JAWS choose the best context in which to analyze the image and generate a description. This is useful for viewing YouTube videos.
- C – Pressing C on your keyboard in the PictureSmart layer will generate a description of the current control. This is useful if the control in focus, such as a button on a webpage, is an image with text embedded in it.
- F – Pressing F in the PictureSmart layer analyzes an image file, such as a JPEG file. To use this feature, simply open a folder in File Explorer with the file you want to analyze. There is no need to open the file. Instead, locate the file, then activate the PictureSmart layer and press F, and your file will be analyzed with a description of the image generated automatically. This is useful for viewing downloaded items, such as screenshots or family pictures.
## Additional Options
While generating descriptions is quite useful, sometimes they may be vague or lack the precise details you need. This is common when you are shopping for items like clothing, home decor, or if you just have a specific detail in mind.
1. If you’d like to get as much detail as possible from your image, use your arrow keys and locate the “Get more details” link in the results viewer. Activating the link with Enter will cause the image to be analyzed again, and descriptions from ChatGPT and Claude will be displayed. This option will offer you the most detailed image descriptions.
2. If you want to ask a specific question, you can add the Alt key to any of the available PictureSmart commands, such as Alt+Enter. This will open a chat box where you can type your question and then have the image analyzed. Otherwise, once the description is generated, you can locate the link in the results viewer to ask ChatGPT about the image. This feature is useful if an important detail, like the color of a shirt or the text printed on it, isn’t provided, or if you just want to know more about a specific aspect of the image.
# Final Thoughts
PictureSmart has revolutionized the JAWS experience. Because of its ability to leverage AI, the feature can generate results within seconds. I hope that this tutorial gives you a starting point to learn more about your screen reader, or gives you the ability to train others on this powerful feature.
