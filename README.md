## About Me

Hello, I'm Caleb! My path has been anything but linear—it began with a deep dive into critical thinking and research in Christian Studies at Grand Canyon University, progressed through the practical world of technical support, and finally evolved into the art of creating clear, accessible technical documentation. I believe that every piece of information has the potential to empower, and that clarity is essential in bridging the gap between technology and its users.

## Background & Education

I earned my degree in Christian Studies with an emphasis in Biblical Studies—a field that honed my research, critical analysis, and written communication skills. These foundations prepared me to dissect complex texts and present them in ways that are accessible and meaningful.

Eager to merge my analytical skills with technical know-how, I later delved into a Ruby backend course and experimented with front-end development using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and even took on Python. Although coding presented a fascinating challenge, I discovered that my true passion lies in transforming intricate technical content into user-friendly documentation. This blend of academic rigor and technical exploration forms the backbone of my approach to technical writing.

## Technical Experience

Over the past five years in technical support and customer service, I’ve developed a deep understanding of the common challenges and pain points faced by users. This experience has taught me the value of clear and empathetic communication and has driven my decision to transition into technical writing. In every guide I create, I draw on real-world experience to ensure that technical content is not only accurate but also accessible to diverse audiences.

## Career Transition

After five years in technical support answering inbound user inquiries, I recognized that my strength lies not in writing code but in writing code documentation and support materials that make a real difference. Transitioning to technical writing has allowed me to leverage my past experiences, turning every technological hurdle into an opportunity to create clearer, more engaging content. My journey is a testament to the fact that sometimes, the most valuable skills come from unexpected places.
